<h1>OpenAPI Toolbox</h1>
<p>This is my toolbox of OpenAPI-driven solutions. This site is a Jekyll-driven website running on Github, using Github Pages. The tools in this toolbox are driven by a YAML file in the _data folder for this repository.</p>
<p>I have them organized by tag, which are always evolving:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/documentation/">Documentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="/generators/">Generators</a></li>
  <li><a href="/server/">Server</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This project is <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">forkable using the Github repository</a>, and accessible as JSON. If you have a tool you think should be added, <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/issues">you can submit an issue on the Github repository</a>.</p>
